	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	I started as a sales assistant with an assigned customer portfolio. Over time, I advanced to a senior sales position and became fully responsible for customer acquisition, managing my own work schedule and market research.
	I enjoy working in industrial companies, especially those linked to the heavy or mining industries, steelworks, foundries, engineering companies, as well as other manufacturing sectors. Apart from the Czech environment, I am well acquainted with the Polish market and the German-speaking countries, not only in terms of language proficiency but also from a cultural and understanding perspective. I have been exposed to the German language since early childhood and, after a short period of refreshment, I am capable of using it at a higher level. The majority of my time outside the Czech Republic has been spent in Poland, with which I have a close relationship, and I enjoy business negotiations with Polish clients.
	<br> <br>
	In 2024, I completed a Ministry of Education accredited retraining course in IT (web application development) offered by the educational institution PrimaKurzy.cz (PrimaFuture.cz s.r.o.).
	I am currently at a junior level in IT and pursue it as a hobby in my free time.
